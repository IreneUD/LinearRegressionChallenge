# LinearRegressionChallenge

Linear regression challenge from Nuwe challenges in which, given a dataset, a linear regression predictive model is performed.

I use Scikit-Learn library to generate the model. More info in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html.

I start uploading train and test datasets with the objective to train the model with the function "LinearRegression()" from sklearn.linear_model. After doing this, I print useful values as rmse, regression coefficients, variance score and intercept value to get more information about our model and data.

Finally, I save predictions of the test model in file results.csv
